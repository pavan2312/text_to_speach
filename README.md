# text_to_speech
This is a simple code for testing text-to-speech conversion library in Python. Trying to implement more with pyttsx3.

To run this you need to use python and compile the code.
User can change code line 27 to as per the need and check the output accordingly.

In this application I am trying to understand the basic usage of test to speech conversion library in Python.
